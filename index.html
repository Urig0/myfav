        <p>Hobby is an activity that can be done in the free time.<br>
            I like to read because I also like to write stories; so I can get some idea to write the story. Reading a book increasing someone's vocabulary. Even we can read anything for just timepass. I like to read even for a break from anything, like studying or anything. Books also increase anybody's knowledge if the book is type of encyclopedia or a textbook, etc. Keep writing and reading, ofcourse and thankyou. </p>

        <hr>
        I like many books, "Harry Potter Series", "Encyclopedias", "Fiction" and "Non-Fiction", and much more.<br><br><br>
        My review for Harry Potter: I am a Harry Potter fan too... The books are fascinating for me. I feel if there was the Hogwarts in the world. And I think J.K. Rowling should write more. <br>
